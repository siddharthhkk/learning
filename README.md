# vscode 🧪🧠

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to my **VS Code lab**, where all my side quests, experiments, and coding chaos live.

This repo is my personal stash of:

🧱 Tiny tools  
🧪 Weird experiments  
🚧 Half-baked projects  
📚 Learning practice  
🔥 Random sparks of curiosity  

All neatly packed into folders — one idea at a time.

## 🗂 What's Inside?

Here’s a peek at how things are organized:

Each folder is its own little world. Some are complete, some are messy — all part of the fun!

## 🎯 Current Focus

Lately, I’ve been spending my energy on:

- 🌐 Brushing up on **web development basics** (HTML, CSS, JS)
- 🤖 Diving into **Machine Learning**
- ⚙️ Building small **functional tools and utilities**
- 📚 Organizing my code and notes in a cleaner way
- 🧠 Learning by doing — and breaking things

## 🚀 Getting Started
